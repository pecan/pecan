    Returns some information about what is going on in a single request.  It
    accepts specific items to report on but uses a default list of items when
    none are passed in.  Based on the requested ``url``, items can also be
    blacklisted.
    Configuration is flexible, can be passed in (or not) and can contain
    some or all the keys supported.

    **items**

    This key holds the items that this hook will display. When this key is
    passed only the items in the list will be used.  Valid items are *any*
    item that the ``request`` object holds, by default it uses the
    following:

    * path
    * status
    * method
    * controller
    * params
    * hooks

    .. note::
        This key should always use a ``list`` of items to use.

    **blacklist**

    This key holds items that will be blacklisted based on ``url``. If
    there is a need to omit urls that start with `/javascript`, then this
    key would look like::

        'blacklist': ['/javascript']

    As many blacklisting items as needed can be contained in the list. The hook
    will verify that the url is not starting with items in this list to display
    results, otherwise it will get omitted.

    .. note::
        This key should always use a ``list`` of items to use.
